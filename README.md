# twenny
A very simple mac-menubar app created with rumps that reminds you to give your eyes a break every twenty seconds. Based on the 202020-rule: Look at something that's 20 metres away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes to prevent your eyes from going bad.
Download the twenny.zip file, extract it, put it in your applications folder and you're good to go!
